# Faster-R-CNN-and-Mask-R-CNN

Faster R-CNN (with a RPN to predict bounding boxes) architecture with a Mask R-CNN branch to identify and segment cars and people in a "Car & Pedestrian" image dataset obtained from the orginial COCO dataset. Used TensorFlow framework for development. Used Google Colaboratory to use GPU while training the model.

Please note:
